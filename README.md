Hello everyone, my name is Matias Reynoso (QA / TAE), I am creating this repository to test the latest version of Cypress (#10) through an e2e dummy test.

To perform these tests I will be using the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website and there I will apply everything learned in this [Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cypress-e2e-automation-testing-con-js-a-fondo/)

Install cypress:

1- npm init -y
2- npm install --save-dev cypress
3- npx cypress open
